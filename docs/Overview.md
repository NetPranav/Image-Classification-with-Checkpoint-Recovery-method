## Image Classification(FashionMNIST) with Checkpoint Recovery Method

## Project Overview 
-This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories (e.g., T-shirts, trousers, shoes) with dimensions of 28x28 pixels.
-The training proccess is the Checkpoint Recovery Method which can save and load the model's `state_dict` to continue the training
